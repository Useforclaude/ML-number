```

#### Kaggle
- **Checkpoint Storage**: `/kaggle/working/` (instant write)
- **Resume**: Automatic - just "Run All"
- **Sync Speed**: Instant (local disk)
- **Data Loss Risk**: Low (if you commit notebook)

**Workflow**:
```
1. Disconnect at epoch 50
2. Reconnect
3. Click "Run All"

   - Test features on small dataset
   - Prototype new ideas quickly

### Option 2: Use Both Simultaneously
1. **Train Model A on Kaggle** (main model)
2. **Train Model B on Colab** (experimental model)
3. **Compare results** after both complete

### Option 3: Data on Kaggle, Inference on Colab
1. **Train on Kaggle** (better GPU, save checkpoint)
2. **Download trained model**
3. **Deploy on Colab** (for inference API, easier sharing)

## üîß Migration Guide

### From Colab to Kaggle (Easy!)

**Step 1**: Upload data as Kaggle Dataset
```bash
# On Colab, download your Drive data
!zip -r data.zip /content/drive/MyDrive/ML_Project/data/

# On local machine, upload to Kaggle Datasets
```

**Step 2**: Use Kaggle notebook
- Copy cells from Colab notebook
- Replace `/content/drive/MyDrive/` with `/kaggle/input/your-dataset/`
- Remove Drive mounting cell
- Run!

**Differences**:
```python
# Colab
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
data_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/ML_Project/data/numberdata.csv'

# Kaggle (simpler!)
data_path = '/kaggle/input/phone-number-price-data/numberdata.csv'
```

### From Kaggle to Colab (if needed)

**Step 1**: Download Kaggle dataset
```bash
# Install Kaggle API
!pip install kaggle

# Download dataset
!kaggle datasets download -d yourusername/your-dataset
!unzip your-dataset.zip
```

**Step 2**: Upload to Google Drive
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Copy data to Drive
!cp -r data /content/drive/MyDrive/ML_Project/
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Kaggle Users:
1. **Always commit notebook** after training (Save Version ‚Üí Save & Run All)
2. **Create datasets for reusability** (upload once, use many times)
3. **Use P100 GPU** (enable in Settings ‚Üí Accelerator ‚Üí GPU P100)
4. **Monitor GPU usage**: `!nvidia-smi` in code cell
5. **Save checkpoints every 10 epochs** (safe against 9-hour timeout)

### For Colab Users:
1. **Always save checkpoints to Drive** (not `/content/` which is temporary)
2. **Verify Drive sync**: Check Drive folder after each checkpoint save
3. **Use Colab Pro for long training** (> 6 hours)
4. **Keep Drive tab open** (to monitor sync status)
5. **Upgrade to Pro if disconnects are frequent**
